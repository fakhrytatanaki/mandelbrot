# Mandelbrot Set
simple c program that calculates and maps the mandelbrot set and saves it as a BMP image

# Note
the project still needs improvements and updates

# Compilation
Although this code is ought to be compatible with C, there currently seems to be issue compiling the code as C,
this will be fixed soon, however the following works just fine with g++

```bash
g++ main.c -Wall -o exec.bin
```
